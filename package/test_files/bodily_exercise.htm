<b>EXERCISE YOURSELF TOWARD GODLINESS</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1 Timothy 4:7-8, �<i>But
reject profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness.
For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all
things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.�</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Exercise.&nbsp; It�s an
important part of maintaining one�s health.&nbsp; Studies have shown this to be true
and with all the health and diet fads that come and go, the fact that we need
exercise remains a constant.&nbsp; What does exercise do for us?&nbsp; It keeps our bodies
in shape, gives us more energy and improves our overall health.&nbsp; Paul�s
reference to exercise addressed the training in gymnasiums of athletes as they
prepared for competitions.&nbsp; Their goal was to develop their bodies to optimum
condition so that they would have every advantage possible.&nbsp; If their abilities
led them to victory they would receive a perishable crown, great praise and
possibly other prizes.&nbsp; Yet Paul said the profit of such things was minute in
comparison to the benefits of spiritual exercise.&nbsp; As Christians, we need to
exercise ourselves �toward godliness�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>What does
exercise toward godliness mean?</b>&nbsp; First of all consider the idea of spiritual
exercise.&nbsp; As already mentioned, exercise is training toward a goal.&nbsp; It is
putting forth effort to better your chances of achieving your goal.&nbsp; In other
words, if we are to be godly, we need to work at it.&nbsp; We need to learn what
godliness is and those things that will help us become that.&nbsp; We also need to
understand that which will hinder us from achieving this state.&nbsp; In reference to
athletic contests, Paul said, �I discipline my body and bring it into
subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become
disqualified.� (1 Corinthians 9:27).&nbsp; Paul�s reference to discipline and
subjecting the body were forms of spiritual exercise (based on the concepts of
physical exercise) that could keep him fit in this race for eternity.&nbsp; He knew
the importance of constant effort in achieving one�s goal.&nbsp; Our �exercise� has
to be ongoing if we are to be pleasing to God.&nbsp; In our text (vs. 7), the word is
a present tense verb meaning ongoing action or a state you are currently in. The
United Bible Society New Testament Handbook says of this verse, �In some
languages an expression like &quot;Work hard to be&quot; (CEV) will be more natural. The
form of the Greek verb is that of a present imperative, emphasizing the
continuity of the action (so TEV &quot;keep yourself in training&quot;). The attainment of
the godly life is not a one-time event; it needs persistent and strenuous effort
both mentally and spiritually. Another way of expressing Train yourself in
godliness is &quot;You must train yourself continually to live a life that shows
reverence to God.&quot;�</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Putting it in
context</b>, Paul has addressed the profane and �old wives� fables that were
obsessing some of the brethren at Ephesus and other places as well.&nbsp; While they
were getting carried away with exercising their minds in these worldly and
bodily pursuits, their benefits were very minute compared to channeling their
efforts toward godliness.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In all of this, let
it be understood that Paul is not saying that we should not exercise.&nbsp; He is
simply stating priorities.&nbsp; Bodily exercise DOES profit a little and as we take
care of our bodies (1 Corinthians 6:18-20) we will be better fit to serve God to
our fullest capacity.&nbsp; But what is it worth if we have a totally fit physical
body if we lose our souls while achieving that? (cf. Matthew 16:26)&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>Toward
godliness.&nbsp; </b>What exactly is this godliness we are to be striving to
achieve?&nbsp; The word means, �reverence, respect, piety toward God, godliness.�
(Thayer)&nbsp; Louw &amp; Nida describe the word as, �behavior reflecting correct
religious beliefs and attitudes�&nbsp; In 1Timothy 2:2 Paul exhorts us to pray for
leaders so that �we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
reverence.�&nbsp; Of this expression, Louw &amp; Nida point out that it could properly be
translated as, ��to live as God would have us live� or �to live as God has told
us we should live.�� &nbsp;In essence, that describes godliness.&nbsp; &nbsp;Are our exercises
in this life directed toward that as a priority?&nbsp; Think about it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In closing let us
consider one more text.&nbsp; Heb 12:1-2 says, <i>�Therefore we also, since we are
surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and
the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that
is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who
for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and
has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.�</i>&nbsp; The weight that the
author says we are to lay aside describes another training exercise.&nbsp; Both now
and back then, one training technique of athletes, especially runners, was to
train with added weight (we call it resistance training) to help build up the
body for the contest.&nbsp; Then when the contest comes, the weights are cast aside
and running the race seems easier.&nbsp; As we continue to exercise ourselves toward
godliness, we must learn to cast off the weights (sin and hindrances) that slow
us down and look toward Jesus at the finish line so that �promise of life that
now is and of that which is to come.�&nbsp; Are you exercising yourself toward
godliness?</p>
