<span style="font-size:10.0pt">This morning I want to talk about a subject that
is of great concern in our society - The subject of commitment.&nbsp; We live in a
self-serving, disposable society today.&nbsp; Far too many make commitments today
only based upon what they can get out of it.&nbsp; Why do so many marriages fail?&nbsp;
Why do so many drop out of school and live mediocre lives? Many, at the first
sign of problems quit their jobs.&nbsp; While there might be many contributing
factors, usually the reason stems from lives that lack commitment.&nbsp; And serving
the Lord is not exempt of this attitude.&nbsp; There are many Christians whose
service to God is far less than committed.&nbsp; My question is, is such an attitude
pleasing to God?&nbsp; In our lesson this morning we want to examine the importance
of true commitment.&nbsp; </span></p>

</span>What Is Commitment?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">a.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1: the trait of sincere and steadfast fixity of purpose; � 2: the act of
binding yourself (intellectually or emotionally) to a course of action; &nbsp;(Wordnet

<span style="font-size:10.0pt">b.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Bible there are several Greek words that are translated into
English with various derivatives of commit.<br>
James 2:9speaks of committing sin<br>
James 5:15 � �And if he has committed sin, he will be forgiven� (Different word
than James 2:9<br>
Acts 8:3 speaks of Paul wreaking havoc and arresting Christians, �committing
them to prison� which means �to give over,�to give into the hands.�.&nbsp; We will
deal with this a little more in a few moments.<br>
1 Timothy 1:11 speaks of �the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was
committed to my trust�<br>
1 Timothy 1:18 � �This charge I commit to you, son Timothy�� referring to
commending, or �to set before�<br>
2 Timothy 1:12 speaks which says, ��for I know whom I have believed and am
persuaded that he is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that day�
the word meaning, a deposit or a thing consigned to one�s faithful keeping
(Thayer)</span></p>

<span style="font-size:10.0pt">c.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As we apply this subject, we want to focus on some of these words,
especially that which has been entrusted to us and that which we entrust to
another.<br>
Thus when we speak of commitment, we mean that which we have entrusted to God
and which He has entrusted to us � which is our ALL.</span></p>

</span>�To give over� � When one becomes a Christian he surrenders his life to
Christ and God � Galatians 2:20; 5:24; Romans 6:6 speaks of the fact that our
old man was crucified with Him.</span></p>

</span>God as entrusted us with His word � the idea of stewardship implies
this.&nbsp; We are also expected to share it with others � 2 Timothy 2:2; 1 Timothy
1:11,18; Titus 1:3</span></p>

</span>The reason so many live half-hearted lives of service to God is because
they have NOT entrusted their all to Him.&nbsp; They are willing to give Him some of
their lives, but not their all.&nbsp; God says this is not enough.&nbsp; He MUST be FIRST.

</span>We can learn much from examples about what is involved in a particular
subject.&nbsp; Let us consider some examples of commitment and the lessons we can
glean from them</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">b.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Jesus � He is our greatest example.&nbsp; Having emptied Himself, He came to
this earth to be rejected by us.&nbsp; He did this because He loves us so much.&nbsp; <br>
At anytime Jesus could have stopped the process, (See John 10:17-18; Matthew
26:52-54) but He knew He was our only hope, so He committed Himself to complete
the demands of His Father so that we might live.<br>
1 Peter 2:21-23 where Peter calls upon us to suffer following the example of&nbsp;
Christ, �<i>Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth; who, when
He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten,
but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously</i>��&nbsp; In the example of our
Lord we find that commitment does not just apply when things are comfortable or
going the way you want them to be.&nbsp; REAL commitment comes when we face adversity
and suffering and we still remain steadfast.<br>
Luke 23:46 � on the cross, as Jesus was about to die, He cried out with a loud
voice and said, �<i>Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit</i>.�</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">c.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Paul � another great New Testament example of commitment.&nbsp; In the example
of Paul we first learn what we must be willing to give up � Philippians 3:3-8.&nbsp;
Paul was going places but he was NOT willing to sell his soul. <br>
Acts 21:13 records the fact that he was willing to die for Christ.&nbsp; You find in
Paul a refusal to compromise, EVER.<br>
Galatians 2:20 summarizes his commitment � �<i>I have been crucified with Christ�</i>�<br>
We also find in Paul hope � 2 Timothy 1:12 � He knew God would keep what he had
committed to Him until that day.</span></p>

</span>Job � Satan challenges God saying, �Does Job fear God for nothing?�
(1:9). His accusation was saying, the only reason Job is faithful is because you
have put a hedge around him.&nbsp; As the account develops, Job loses everything
except his life.&nbsp; Yet in all that he says, �<i>Though He slay me, yet will I
trust Him. Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him. He also shall be my
salvation, for a hypocrite could not come before Him.�</i> (13:15)&nbsp; <br>
True commitment will cause us to trust God even when times are tough.&nbsp; This is
how one is willing and able to die for Him knowing that God knows what is best.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:10.0pt">e.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hezekiah � 2 Chronicles 31 records the reforms of Hezekiah as Judah is
turned back toward God including braking down the pillars of idolatry and
restoring true worship.&nbsp; Verses 1-2 points to some of these reforms � they break
down the pillars of their idols and restore true worship.&nbsp; Verses 20-21 say, �<i>Thus
Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true
before the LORD his God. &nbsp;And in every work that he began in the service of the
house of God, in the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did it with
all his heart. So he prospered</i>.�<br>
The commitment of leaders often moves others to righteousness and it involves
the heart.</span></p>

</span>Acts 4:19, Peter stands up before the Sanhedrin defending His faith � we
HAVE to do this.&nbsp; Consider the determination of Peter � not too long before this

of Jesus we find doubt.&nbsp; Now we find Peter with such conviction that NOTHING
will stop him from standing up for God.</span></p>

� Mark 12:30, when asked what is the first commandment, Jesus answered, Love God
with all your heart, mind, soul and strength.&nbsp; This was actually a quote from
Deuteronomy 6:4-5 where Moses was challenging Israel to provoke God�s blessings
(vs. 3).<br>
When we look at the good examples of God�s word we find men and women who loved
God and committed their lives to glorifying Him.&nbsp; Consider Daniel, Abraham,
David, Paul, Peter, and even Jesus as we have noted.&nbsp; Many who overcame Satan
�by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not
love their lives to the death� (Revelation 12:11)<br>
Revelation 2:10 is a challenge to �<i>be faithful unto death</i>� so that you can
receive the crown of life.<br>

your soul.<br>

worldliness</span></i></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt"> � Living in a world
filled with temptation where ungodliness and worldliness is often paraded
proudly, it takes commitment to do the right thing.&nbsp; Living in a society that
encourages and even rewards selfish pursuits requires commitment to stay on the
right path.<br>
In God�s word we are constantly warned to resist the devil and temptation.&nbsp; We
are called upon to overcome wickedness and have NOTHING to do with it.<br>
Ephesians 5:7 says, �<i>Therefore, do not be partakers with them</i>�<br>
Proverbs 8:13 says, �<i>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; Pride and arrogance
and the evil way and the perverse mouth I hate</i>�<br>

� Godly families are the key to a godly society.&nbsp; So many problems in our
society are a result of broken and undisciplined families.&nbsp; Divorce almost
always results from a lack of commitment.&nbsp; Usually, children fall away and live
rebellious lives because commitment to God is not instilled in them by godly
examples and teaching.&nbsp; After Moses challenged Israel to love God with all their
heart, he called upon them to teach these things to their children. (Deut.
6:6-9). One of the key reasons for Israel�s failure can be attributed to their
failure to commit what they had been taught to their children (See Judges 2:10)&nbsp;
<br>
God�s word gives clear instructions for a healthy family � both the husband/wife
relationship and the parent/child relationship.&nbsp; If we are committed to these
values we drastically increase our chances of a happy, healthy family that will
be productive.&nbsp; Proverbs 22:6 says, �T<i>rain up a child in the way he should go,
and when he is old he will not depart from it.</i>�&nbsp; The New Testament backs this up
(Ephesians 6:1-4, Colossians 3:18-21, etc.)<br>

your true commitment to God?</span></p>
